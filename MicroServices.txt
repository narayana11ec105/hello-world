Micro-services - 
* An architectural style
* Decomposing single system into a suite of small services each running as independent processes and 
communicationg via open protocols
* Fine-grained SOA

* Single application as a suite of smaller apps (Not monolithic)
* seperately written, deployed, scaled
* Services are independently upgradeable
SOA - about integrating various enterprise applications
MicroServices - Decompose single app to smaller services

Monolithic disadvantages -
1. Commitment to single language/Technology stack forever - cannot try new techs for specific module/units
2. Modularity is based on a specific language
3. Entire app in single language
4. Single team/developer cannot digest a large code-base
5. Larger teams are hard to manage

Micro-services adv
1. Several components can use different tech stack based on requirement 
2. All components sit behind API Gateway which provide best interface for the client in question
3. Services are independent apps
4. Changes scoped only to the affected service
5. Multiple components can use a different language
6. Communication over common light-weight protocol like HTTP, TCP, UDP etc
7. Payloads like JSON etc
8. Each business function as a service vs in monolithic - each func as a component
9. Each service exposes API's / Rest endpoints
10. Easy to modify, learn, smaller teams
11. Independent deployments, management
12. Change cycle decoupled

Micro-services disadvantages -
1.Services may be unavailable while remote calls - not a problem in monolithic
2. Design for failure
3. Remote calls more costlier than in-process calls - more latency etc
4. More monitoring needed.
5. Pain if a change has to go to multiple spans of the service
6. Refactoring becomes pain in case of wrond designs etc

How to break a monolith to micro services ?
1. Noun-based (customer , product etc)
2. Verb-based (Search ,checkout , pay)
3. Single Responsibility principle
4. Bounded Context

How small is Micro - An individual / a small team should be able to maintain

Smart services and dumb integration technology - MicroServices
Dumb services and smart integration technology - SOA

Spring Cloud - 
===================================================================================
Cloud apps are usually distributed apps
Provides libraries to apply common patterns needed in distributed applications like ,
1. Distributed Config management
2. Load balancing
3. Ser to service calls
4. Circuit breakers
5. Routing 

* Spring team made netflix technologies easily consumable, 
* Spring cloud projects are mostly cloud based
* Spring Cloud - Address common patterns in distributed apps - Enables easy use of netflix projects

Spring Cloud Config - 
App Configuration Options - 
1. Package Config files with application 
2. Storing conf files in a shared location - problematic in a cloud
3. Use ENV variables - problem when there are many env variables
4. Using cloud-vendor specific solution - app tightly coupled with that vendor

Desired Solution for Configuration - 
1. Platform/Cloud independent solution
2. Centralized
3. Dynamic - update settings while app is running
4. Controllable - Same SCM choices we use with software
5. Passive - Apps/ services should do most of the work when it comes up - like saying that I'm up and this is my URL  - spring cloud comes in 

Spring Cloud Config - Helps in app configuration
Spring Cloud Bus - Provides simple way to notify clients to config changes/ push dynamic changes
Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka - Service Discovery - Allow apps to register themselves as clients

Spring Cloud Config Server
----------------------------------------------------------------
Is itself an App that serves configuration information to other apps usually over HTTP
* Client apps connect to config server for config information
* Configuration information can be stored in any SCM like GIT , flies , DB etc

Environment Respositry - Where you store config files - It's an interface
Obtain settings from server - http://<server>:<port>/spring.application.name/<profile>

There is an application called lucky-word and profile is set to north america 
 - Spring client makes an http request for /lucky-word/northamerica 
 
File search would happen based on the appName and profile type - all file names with default will be ignored
ex - file with name like lucky-word-northamerica.yml(1st precedence), lucky-word.yml(2nd precedence), lucky-word.propeties(3rd precedence) would be selected
                 
* Spring cloud chooses yml files over properties
* Config file should be named after the application

.yml(.yaml) vs .properties
=========================================================================
Yaml -
------------------------------------------------------
--- <Starts with three dashes>
spring:
	config:
		name: aaa
		location: bbb
    profiles:
		active: ccc
	    include: ddd

Equivalent properties - 
-------------------------------------------------------
spring.config.name=aaa
spring.config.location=bbb
spring.profiles.active=ccc
spring.profiles.include=ddd

Advantages of Yaml over properties - 
1. Multiple set of properties can be combined in one file wuth 3 dash separates, which otherwise would need 12 separate .properties file

How properties work in spring - 
* Spring apps have an Environment object/ an interface that hold different PropertySources which are populated from different 
sources like environment properties, 
system properties, developer defined property files etc
* All spring cloud config library does is, It adds another PropertySource that connects to a config server over http and gets 
config information to populate newly added PropertySource 
result - property defined by server became part of client app.

For Non-Java/ non-spring - 
Consume a rest service exposed by spring config server using any other language
http://<server>:<port>/<spring.application.name>/<profile>

What if configuration server is down - 
1. Several instances are run behind a load balancer - failing one should not matter
2. Client application can control policy of how to handle missing config server 
	- spring.cloud.config.failFast=true (default = false)

* Settings received from config server override local settings, local settings can be used as a fallback strategy
>>> netstat -nap | grep <port-number> -----> To see PID of process listening at a specific port number
>>> lsof -i :<port number>

Service Discovery -
=================================
What is it?? Example - A chat client
* A client(When you online in a chat client) registers itself with the server that it has come online
* Server provides the client with the list of all clients online
* You as client has been discovered by other clients and you discover other clients, due to active registering

In microServices there are many interservice calls and its very challenging to manually do it

How does one service know all other services that are there ?? -- Service Discovery
* It provides single look-up service
  - Clients register themselves and discover other registrants
* Several solutions like Eureka, Etcd, Zookeeper, SmartStack etc

* Eureka for service Discovery - provided by Netflix
	- Eureka provides a lookup server
	- Made highly by running multiple copies(these copies interact bewteen them)
	- Client services register with Eureka, sends some metadat like host, port, health check URL etc.
	- Clients send heartBeats to Eureka server, Eureka removes clients without heartbeats
* Add spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server to dependency
* Include @EnableEurekaServer annotation
* Eureka servers communicate within them, shares state(Synchronize with other servers)
* Ideally run in different regions/ server racks
* Each server should know the URL to the others(config server provides this)

@EnableDiscoverClient - 
	- Automatically register clients with the server
	- registers app name, host, port
	- Use DiscoveryClient to locate other services/clients
* Eureka server maintains all registrations in memory, doesnt persist that anywhere
* Eureka should have peers in production 
* Config First Bootstrap - use config server to locate eureka server --> App bootstraps with Config server first
* Eureka First Bootstrap - Use eureka to expose config server as another client

Spring Cloud Ribbon - client side load balancing
========================================================================================
SW loadbalancers - Apache, Nginx
Client-side load balancer is a part of client software , it selects which server to call
There can be multiple server side Load Balancers - In case one of the LB fails, client will know that it can route reqs to other LB'saying

Caching - service will not make the remote call as it has response received from previous similar calls
Batching - multiple reqs will be grouped into one req - for efficiency

* Ribbon - developed by Netflix
* Spring cloud provided wasy to use wrapper around ribbon
* List of servers - what servers are there for different clients(services) - this is usually populated via (ServiceDiscovery) Eureka
* Spring Cloud default - use Eureka when present on classpath

Example - 
	stores:
		ribbon:
			listOfServers: store1.com, store2.com
		products:
			listOfServers: prodServer1.com, prodServer2.com
			
* Ribbon filters servers based on some criteria
	-> default - filter servers only in the same zone
* Spring cloud - default LB - ZoneAwareLoadBalancer
* Rule - default - ZoneAwareRule

Spring Cloud Feign - Declarative Rest Client
===========================================================================================
* Alternative to restTemplate, even easier - 
* Feign declarative rest client - Allows to make rest calls
* Eliminate unit testing as there is no code(integration test is however necessary)
How does feign client works - 
----------------------------------------
1. Define interfaces for the rest client code -
2. Annotate interface with Feign annotation - 
3. Define methods that are to be done as remote calls - with proper return type and parameters(name doesn't matter)
4. Annotate methods with proper spring MVC annotations
5. Spring cloud will implement it at runtime - It will scan for all the interfaces and provide implementation code to call REST service 
   and process response.
 
Feign Example - Add @EnableFeignClients to Application.class
--------------------------------
@FeignClient(url = "http://localhost:8080/warehouse")  ------>base url of the server we call or @FeignClient("clientId")
public Interface InventoryClient(){

@RequestMapping(value = "/inventory" , method = RequestMethod.GET)  ---> RequestMapping says that for getting items, it needs to look at this path 
List<Item> getItems();

@RequestMapping(value="/inventory/{sku}" method = RequestMethod.POST , consumes = "application/json")
void update(@PathVariable("sku") String sku, @RequestBody Item item);

}

Feign integrates with Ribbon and Eureka
