* Docker - one implementation of container based virtualization technologies

* Pre-virtualization -> 
	Hard to migrate from one server provider to the other(Ex., from IBM to Dell servers)
	Less amount resources will be used leading to wastage

* Hypervisor based virtualization - 
	One physical server, multiple OS - providers include vmWare, Virtual Box
	An hypervisor layer is introduced between physical HW and Guest OS

* Now companies are installing VM's on cloud like AWS
