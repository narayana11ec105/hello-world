Routable protocol - 
Protocols which allows a network to be divided into sub-networks. All subnetwork talk to each other via a router.'
IP - OSI layer 3 - network layer
TCP - OSI layer 4 - transport layer

Non-routable -
Every computer is connected to every other computer, complete mess

IP is for locating computers on the internet, TCP helps in communication between them.
Windowing - client sends data to server in the form of packets, smaller chunks of data. It starts with smaller number of packets and increases the number of packets as the server receives
everything successfully. Resets / resorts back to smallest number of packets when the server fails to receive some packets.

Every device on the internet has to have an 
IP
Subnet Mask
Default gateway - router for the subnet mask, Enables a computer to talk to other devices that are on the internet.
DNS - domain name server - domain names to IP address mapping
DHCP - Dynamic Host Control Protocol - 

static IP - assign IP, DNS, default gateway manually
Dynamic IP - Computer gets the IP, subnet mask, default gateway etc from the DHCP when it connects to the network. 
DHCP - can give out IP's based on a scope(10.100.4.90 - 10.100.4.190), keeps track of all the IP's given out, gives default gateway,
subnet mask etc to the requesting comp on the network. This info is given with a LEASE time (how long can the machine keep the config)
Halfway through the least time mark, computer makes another call to DHCP to renew the configs.
