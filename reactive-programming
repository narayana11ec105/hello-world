Reactive programming basics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecture that supports - 
  * Scalable
  * resilience -  Error handling
  * Responsive- less response time to user
  * event-driven
  
Iterator - pull data when hasNext
Observable - Keep pushing data to user, he cares or not.

Observable pattern - 
Error channel --> Send errors in error channel, unlike exceptions and errors.
Data channel --> send data stream here, until complete signal/ error occurs
Complete channel --> Signal for complete comes.
